The ZIP file includes all of the necessary files to run MixRegLS via R.  
There are two Word documents in the ZIP file that include and explain the examples - MixRegLS_viaR_short and MixRegLS_viaR_full.  These were created with knitr using the similarly named .RMD files, which are also in the ZIP file.  
There are two Windows EXE files (mixreg.exe and mixregls_2rs_cpm64.exe) that are necessary for running the MixRegLS program.  These were created using the Fortran programming language.   
The two PDF files are the original manual of the program (mixregls.pdf) and a file describing the analysis specified in the HealthBehavAcadPerfAffect.R file. 
The two R files (mixregls_2rs_formula_cpm.R and mixregls_2rs_function_cpm.R) translate the R code to the Fortran EXE files and also format the output that the program sends back.
